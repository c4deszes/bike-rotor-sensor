iTPMS failure modes

.. fmea:: False assumption of low tire pressure
    :id: FMEA_SW_ITPMS_FALSE_POSITIVE
    :status: draft
    :probability: occasional
    :severity: minor
    :detection: high
    :mitigation: none

    The preride checklist already includes checking tire pressure visually.

.. fmea:: False assumption of no tire pressure
    :id: FMEA_SW_ITPMS_FALSE_NEGATIVE
    :status: draft
    :probability: occasional
    :severity: minor
    :detection: high
    :mitigation: none

    Low tire pressure will eventually be detected, just like deflated tires.
